	<p>I would nover give up on us no matter how hard it gets, i told you I wanted you for life and that isn't changing.You've showed me what real happiness and love is like. please don't ever leave me.I will love you until my last breath.
Are You Afraiding I Will Cheat Read This,me cheat? nah, the first thing i do when i wake up is check if i got a message from you. <3
 It's unhealthy how much I want you.I sit and wait for your texts and ignore everybody else's every single day. Nobody looks as good as you do in my eyes.if my efforts are not enough,forgive me bc
idk how to show that but i really love you.I never wanted perfect,
  i just wanted real but I guess found both in you LIFE IS YOURS, DEATH IS MINE PEACE IS YOURS, STRESS IS MINE HAPPINESS IS YOURS, SORROW IS MINE EVERYTHING IS YOURS, BUT YOU ARE MINE
